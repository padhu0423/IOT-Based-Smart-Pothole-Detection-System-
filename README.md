# IOT-Based-Smart-Pothole-Detection-System-
The Pothole Detection System is a real-time road monitoring solution designed to improve transportation safety and road quality monitoring. The system uses an MPU6050 accelerometer sensor to detect sudden vertical jolts and vibrations typically caused by potholes or road irregularities. Simultaneously, a GPS module captures the exact location (latitude and longitude) of the detected pothole.

An ESP32 microcontroller processes this data and uploads the pothole's GPS coordinates to a Firebase Realtime Database over Wi-Fi. This live database can be accessed by authorities, developers, or navigation systems to map and respond to pothole-related hazards, enabling smarter road maintenance and safer travel.
